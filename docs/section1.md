*Five sessions of cherishing mistakes and learning from errors*

## Overview

The first section of the course focuses on developing critical skills in recognizing and learning from mistakes. Rather than viewing errors as failures, this section teaches you to see them as valuable opportunities for discovery and learning.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Detect nonsense** in arguments and reasoning
- **Check for errors** systematically in your work
- **Identify false assumptions** that lead thinking astray
- **Develop a positive attitude** toward mistakes as learning opportunities
- **Practice fact-checking** before jumping to explanations

## Core Concepts

### The Value of Mistakes

Professor Winfree emphasized that mistakes are "often the most available doors to discovery." This section helps you:

- Recognize when you've made an error
- Understand why the error occurred
- Extract valuable learning from the mistake
- Avoid similar errors in the future

### Facts Before Explanations

One of the fundamental principles taught in this section is to establish facts before attempting to explain them. Many errors in reasoning come from trying to explain phenomena that haven't been properly observed or verified.

## Sample Problems and Exercises

### Triangle Problem
A foundational exercise demonstrating the need for careful problem analysis and assumption checking.

### 13 Nails Problem
An exercise in approaching problems from multiple angles and questioning initial assumptions.

### Golden Tooth Exercise
Practice in distinguishing between established facts and speculative explanations.

## Historical Examples

### N-Rays Incident
Study of how respected scientists can fall into error through confirmation bias and inadequate error checking.

### Pathological Science
Examination of cases where good scientists made systematic errors in observation and reasoning.

## Practical Skills Developed

- **Systematic error checking** methods
- **Assumption questioning** techniques
- **Fact verification** procedures
- **Collaborative error detection** through peer review
- **Documentation** of reasoning processes for later review

## The GameWorth Approach

In your daily GamesWorth sessions for this section, focus on:

1. **Recording your assumptions** explicitly
2. **Documenting your reasoning** step by step
3. **Identifying potential error sources** in your approach
4. **Practicing recovery** from dead ends and mistakes
5. **Celebrating discoveries** that emerge from errors

## Readings and Resources

Key readings for this section include:

- Adams Chapter 1: Introduction to conceptual blocks
- Platt: "The Art of Creative Thinking"
- Feynman: "Cargo Cult Science"
- Selected articles on scientific errors and their lessons

## Assessment Focus

Your work in this section will be evaluated on:

- **Effort and engagement** rather than "correct" answers
- **Quality of error analysis** in your GamesWorth notebook
- **Demonstration of learning** from mistakes
- **Collaborative contributions** to class discussions
- **Reflection on thinking processes** rather than just results

*Remember: The goal is not to avoid mistakes, but to learn how to make them productively and recover from them creatively.*
