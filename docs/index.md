## About This Course

Welcome to **The Art of Scientific Discovery**, a unique 3-credit course originally designed by the renowned scientist and educator [**Professor Arthur T. Winfree**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Winfree){target=_blank} at the University of Arizona. This course represents a revolutionary approach to developing your ability to solve problems like those encountered in scientific investigations.

!!! info "Original Course Materials"
    This website is based on Professor Winfree's original syllabus and course materials. You can view the [original PDF syllabus](../The%20Art%20of%20Scientific%20Discovery%20Syllabus.pdf) that forms the foundation of this course.

Unlike traditional lecture courses, this is an active learning experience focused on developing your problem-solving skills and creative thinking abilities through hands-on practice and collaborative learning.

!!! quote "Course Philosophy"
    "The aim of this course is to develop your ability to solve problems like those encountered in scientific investigations. We examine how specific problems were solved in the past, examine 'inspirational readings', and tackle selected puzzles for pencil and paper and for simple lab manipulation."

## What Makes This Course Different

This course operates on the principle that **problem-solving can be taught and improved**. Rather than passively absorbing information, you'll engage in:

- **Practice scrimmages** in strategy and tactics
- **Recognizing ignorance** and posing better questions  
- **Cultivating multiple alternative solutions**
- **Learning from mistakes** as doors to discovery
- **Developing a positive attitude toward failure**

## Core Learning Approach

### The Three Main Tools

1. **ðŸ“š [Readings](readings.md)** - Inspirational materials from diverse scientific fields
2. **ðŸ§© Problems** - Practice exercises designed as "intellectual barbells"
3. **ðŸ‘¥ Collaborative Learning** - Daily exchange of insights with peers

### [The GamesWorth Method](gamesworth.md)

Central to the course is developing a daily **"Game's-Worth" (GW)** practice - focused, uninterrupted thinking sessions where you:

- Log your problem-solving approaches
- Document insights and blind alleys  
- Reflect on your thinking process
- Share strategies with classmates

## Course Structure

The semester is organized into five major sections:

### [Section 1: Detecting Nonsense & Error Checking](section1.md)
Learn to spot false assumptions, value mistakes, and check for errors in reasoning.

### [Section 2: Creative Blocks](section2.md)
Identify and overcome perceptual, emotional, cultural, and intellectual barriers to problem-solving.

### [Section 3: Observations & Questions](section3.md)
Develop skills in making keen observations and asking productive questions.

### [Section 4: Patterns & Empirical Generalizations](section4.md)
Practice recognizing patterns and forming generalizations from data.

### [Section 5: Inferences, Hypotheses & Explanations](section5.md)
Learn to construct and evaluate explanations for observed phenomena.

## Key Philosophy

> **"We are all born with [problem-solving ability] and mostly lose it during and because of schooling and the general intimidation that comes with any competitive society. We can refine and enhance it about as much as we please."**

This course provides a structured environment to:

- **Rediscover** your natural problem-solving abilities
- **Experiment** with different thinking styles
- **Practice** without the pressure of immediate "correct" answers
- **Develop** habits that will benefit your entire future career

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will have:

- âœ… Enhanced creative problem-solving abilities
- âœ… Multiple strategies for approaching unfamiliar problems  
- âœ… Confidence in tackling complex, ambiguous challenges
- âœ… Skills in collaborative thinking and peer learning
- âœ… A personal toolkit of thinking methods and approaches

## Getting Started

Your journey begins with developing the **daily GamesWorth habit** - a commitment to regular, focused problem-solving practice. This isn't just about completing assignments; it's about transforming how you approach challenges in all areas of life.

!!! tip "Remember"
    "In this course actually solving the practice problems is way less important than learning how to try (and, for grading, demonstrating real effort.)"
