### Periodicals and Current Sources

Professor Winfree emphasized the importance of current scientific literature, noting that many readings came from:

- Current scientific journals and magazines
- Recent conference proceedings  
- Contemporary case studies in scientific discovery
- Modern examples of scientific problem-solving

*Note: Many readings were distributed as xeroxed handouts, updated each semester to include the most current examples and case studies.*

## Reading Approach for This Course

### Active Reading Strategy

As Professor Winfree emphasized:

> "I expect you to commit to paper a page per class session to celebrate the best things you find or think of while involved with these readings."

**For each reading:**

- **Underline key concepts** and mark important passages
- **Make marginal notes** with your thoughts and questions
- **Write a full page** of reflection on the best insights
- **Create a checklist** of good ideas for your problem-solving toolkit
- **Practice techniques** suggested in the readings during your GamesWorth sessions

### Building Your Problem-Solving Toolkit

Keep a running list of:

- **Useful techniques** you discover in the readings
- **Common pitfalls** to avoid
- **Questions to ask** when stuck on problems
- **Ways to check** your reasoning
- **Methods for generating** alternative approaches

### Integration with Practice

The readings are not meant to be passively absorbed but actively applied:

- **Test techniques** from readings on course problems
- **Compare approaches** from different authors
- **Adapt methods** to your personal thinking style  
- **Share insights** with classmates during notebook exchanges
- **Reflect on effectiveness** in your morning-after reconsiderations

*Remember: The goal is not just to read about problem-solving, but to transform these insights into practical skills through deliberate practice and reflection.*
