*Daily practice in focused thinking and problem-solving*

## What is a "GamesWorth"?

A **GamesWorth (GW)** is Professor Winfree's term for a focused, uninterrupted session of serious thinking - roughly equivalent to the mental effort required to play one game of serious chess. The name comes from Platt's "The Art of Creative Thinking," which emphasizes the importance of sustained, concentrated mental effort.

!!! quote "The GamesWorth Concept"
    "Use these homework puzzles to nucleate a habit of doing a daily 'Game's-Worth' of focused thought... This might be the most important (potentially enduring) effect of the course."

## The Daily Practice

### Time Commitment

- **Minimum:** One hour of uninterrupted thinking daily
- **Frequency:** 5-7 times per week (ideally daily)
- **Consistency:** Same time and place when possible
- **Quality over Quantity:** Better to do 45 minutes of focused work than 2 hours with interruptions

### The Sacred Hour
Professor Winfree emphasized that interruptions destroy the value of thinking sessions:

> "An hour's work punctuated with three 5-minute interruptions has lost you not 15 minutes... it has instead prevented you getting warmed up to 60-minute heat, replacing that experience by 3 times getting up to 15-minute heat."

## The GamesWorth Notebook

### Physical Requirements

- **Bound notebook** (not loose-leaf) - wire spiral binding acceptable
- **Right-hand pages only** for primary work
- **Left-hand pages** reserved for specific purposes
- **Numbered pages** for easy cross-referencing
- **Professional quality** - legible like an industrial research notebook

### Documentation Requirements

**At the start of each session:**

- **Date and time** you begin
- **Location** where you're working
- **Page numbers** used in this session
- **Problem or topic** you're addressing

**During the session:**

- **All your work** - including false starts and dead ends
- **Your reasoning process** - not just final answers
- **Alternative approaches** you try
- **Insights and breakthroughs** as they occur
- **Questions that arise** during your thinking

**At the end of each session:**

- **Time you finish** and total duration
- **Summary** of what you accomplished
- **Key insights** or progress made
- **Questions for next** session
- **Brief reflection** on your thinking process

## Using the Left-Hand Pages

### Two Primary Functions

**1. In-Class Notes**

- Record important points from class discussions
- Note insights from classmates' presentations
- Document group problem-solving approaches

**2. Morning-After Reconsiderations**

This is the most valuable use of left-hand pages:

- **Return weeks later** to problems you worked on
- **Analyze your thinking** with fresh perspective
- **Identify where you got stuck** and why
- **See alternative approaches** you missed
- **Compare your method** with classmates' approaches
- **Recognize patterns** in your problem-solving style

## Creating the Optimal Environment

### Physical Environment

- **Quiet space** free from interruptions
- **Large work surface** for spreading out materials
- **Good lighting** and comfortable seating
- **No distractions** - TV, music, or social media
- **All materials** within reach before starting

### Mental Environment

- **Clear your mind** of other concerns before beginning
- **Set specific goals** for the session
- **Accept that confusion** and frustration are normal
- **Focus on process** rather than immediate results
- **Maintain curiosity** and playfulness

## What to Work On

### Problem-Solving Practice

- **Assigned puzzles** from class
- **Personal challenges** you encounter
- **Extensions** of class problems
- **Creative variations** on familiar problems

### Reflection and Analysis

- **Review previous** work for new insights
- **Analyze your thinking** patterns and habits
- **Connect different** problems and approaches
- **Plan strategies** for upcoming challenges

### Reading Integration

- **Process key insights** from course readings
- **Create personal** problem-solving checklists
- **Connect reading concepts** to problem-solving practice
- **Develop your own** thinking frameworks

## The Collaborative Dimension

### Daily Exchanges

- **Share notebooks** with classmates regularly
- **Learn from others'** approaches and insights
- **Offer constructive** feedback on peers' work
- **Compare different** thinking styles and methods

### What Makes a Good Exchange

- **Clear documentation** that others can follow
- **Honest recording** of struggles and breakthroughs
- **Thoughtful analysis** rather than just final answers
- **Generous sharing** of insights and methods

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### "I Don't Have Time"
- Start with shorter, more focused sessions
- Protect the time as rigorously as you would a medical appointment
- Remember that quality matters more than quantity
- Consider the long-term benefits to your thinking skills

### "I Don't Know What to Think About"
- Return to previous problems with fresh eyes
- Extend class problems in new directions
- Look for patterns across different problems
- Practice explaining solutions to imaginary students

### "I Get Stuck Too Easily"
- Record your stuck points rather than abandoning them
- Try approaching from completely different angles
- Take breaks within the session to reset your thinking
- Remember that getting stuck is part of the learning process

### "My Work Isn't Good Enough"
- Focus on effort and process rather than correct answers
- Document your reasoning process thoroughly
- Learn from mistakes rather than hiding them
- Remember that everyone struggles with difficult problems

## The Long-Term Benefits

### Immediate Course Benefits
- **Better problem-solving** performance in class
- **Deeper understanding** of course concepts
- **More effective collaboration** with classmates
- **Greater confidence** in tackling difficult problems

### Lifelong Benefits
- **Enhanced creativity** and innovation ability
- **Better analytical** thinking skills
- **Increased tolerance** for ambiguity and confusion
- **More systematic** approach to complex challenges
- **Greater persistence** in the face of difficulty

## Assessment and Evaluation

Your GamesWorth notebook will be evaluated on:

- **Consistency** of daily practice
- **Quality of documentation** and reflection
- **Evidence of learning** and growth over time
- **Thoughtfulness** of morning-after reconsiderations
- **Collaboration** quality in exchanges with peers

Remember: The goal is not to produce perfect solutions, but to develop the habits and skills of sustained, creative thinking that will benefit you throughout your life.

*"The purpose of making this a formal 'course' is to provide you a legitimate (regularly scheduled, graded) escape from the usual pressures, during which to consciously cultivate skills and personal style in problem solving."*
